![rama roadmap v0.2.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plabayo/rama/main/docs/img/roadmap.svg)

## Nightly

`rama` is currently only available on nightly rust,
this is because it uses the `async_trait` feature,
which is currently only available on nightly rust.

We expect to be able to switch back to stable rust once `async_trait` is available on stable rust,
which should be by the end of 2023.

See <https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2023/05/03/stabilizing-async-fn-in-trait.html> for more information.

## Contributing

:balloon: Thanks for your help improving the project! We are so happy to have
you! We have a [contributing guide][contributing] to help you get involved in the
`rama` project.

Should you want to contribure this project but you do not yet know how to program in Rust, you could start learning Rust with as goal to contribute as soon as possible to `rama` by using "[the Rust 101 Learning Guide](https://rust-lang.guide/)" as your study companion. Glen can also be hired as a mentor or teacher to give you paid 1-on-1 lessons and other similar consultancy services. You can find his contact details at <https://www.glendc.com/>.

## License

This project is dual-licensed under both the [MIT license][mit-license] and [Apache 2.0 License][apache-license].

### Contribution

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted
for inclusion in `rama` by you, shall be licensed as both [MIT][mit-license] and [Apache 2.0][apache-license],
without any additional terms or conditions.

## Sponsors

Rama is **completely free, open-source software** which needs lots of effort and time to develop and maintain.

Support this project by becoming a [sponsor][ghs-url]. One time payments are accepted [at GitHub][ghs-url] as well as at ["Buy me a Coffee"][bmac-url]

Sponsors help us continue to maintain and improve `rama`, as well as other
Free and Open Source (FOSS) technology. It also helps us to create
educational content such as <https://github.com/plabayo/learn-rust-101>,
and other open source libraries such as <https://github.com/plabayo/tower-async>.

Sponsors receive perks and depending on your regular contribution it also
allows you to rely on us for support and consulting.

If you plan to use Rama for your commercial resell or package activities you
need to be a sponsor for a high enough tier to allow you to use it
for these purposes despite it having a Business License (BSL).

### Contribute to Open Source

Part of the money we receive from sponsors is used to contribute to other projects
that we depend upon. Plabayo sponsors the following organisations and individuals
building and maintaining open source software that `rama` depends upon:

| | name | projects |
| - | - | - |
| ðŸ’Œ | [Tokio (*)](https://github.com/tokio-rs) | (Tokio Project and Ecosystem)
| ðŸ’Œ | [Sean McArthur](https://github.com/seanmonstar) | (Hyper and Tokio)
| ðŸ’Œ | [Ulixee](https://github.com/ulixee) | (Browser Profile Data)

> (*) we no longer depend upon `tower` directly, and instead
> have made a permanent fork of it, available at: <https://github.com/plabayo/tower-async>

## FAQ

### Why the name rama?

The name _rama_ is Japanese for llama and written as "ãƒ©ãƒž".
This animal is used as a our mascot and spiritual inspiration of this proxy framework.
It was chosen to honor our connection with Peru, the homeland of this magnificent animal,
and translated into Japanese because we gratefully have built _rama_
upon the broad shoulders of [Tokio and its community](https://tokio.rs/).

### Help! My Async Trait's Future is not `Send`

Due to a bug in Rust, most likely its trait resolver,
you can currently run into this not very meanigful error.

Cfr: <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/114142>

By using the 'turbo fish' syntax you can resolve it.
See that issue for more details on this solution.
