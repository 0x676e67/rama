## Nightly

`rama` is currently only available on nightly rust,
this is because it uses the `async_trait` feature,
which is currently only available on nightly rust.

We expect to be able to switch back to stable rust once `async_trait` is available on stable rust,
which should be by the end of 2023.

See <https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2023/05/03/stabilizing-async-fn-in-trait.html> for more information.

## FAQ

### Why the name rama?

The name _rama_ is Japanese for llama and written as "ãƒ©ãƒž".
This animal is used as a our mascot and spiritual inspiration of this proxy framework.
It was chosen to honor our connection with Peru, the homeland of this magnificent animal,
and translated into Japanese because we gratefully have built _rama_
upon the broad shoulders of [Tokio and its community](https://tokio.rs/).
