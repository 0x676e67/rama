ü¶ô Rama is a modular proxy framework for the ü¶Ä Rust language to move and transform your network packets.
The reasons behind the creation of rama can be read in [the "Why Rama" chapter](https://ramaproxy.org/book/why_rama).

You can use it to develop:

- üö¶ [Reverse proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/reverse);
- üîì [TLS Termination proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/tls);
- üåê [HTTP(S) proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/http);
- üß¶ [SOCKS5 proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/socks5);
- üîé [MITM proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/mitm);
- üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è [Distortion proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/distort).

Rama is async-first using [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) as its _only_ Async Runtime.
Please refer to [the examples found in the `./examples` dir](./examples)
to get inspired on how you can use it for your purposes.

- Learn more by reading the Rama book at <https://ramaproxy.org/book>
- or checkout the framework Rust docs at <https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama>.

There is no [crates.io](https://crates.io) release of rama yet. If you already want to start using rama already your can do so by referring to it in your `Cargo.toml` as follows:

```
rama = { git = "https://github.com/plabayo/rama" }
```

üí¨ Come join us at [Discord][discord-url] on the `#rama` public channel. To ask questions, discuss ideas and ask how rama may be useful for you.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è rama is early work in progress, use at your own risk.
>
> Not everything that exists is documented and not everything that is documented is implemented.

üìñ Rama's full documentatuon, references and background material can be found in the form of the "rama book" at <https://ramaproxy.org/>.

## ‚õ® | Safety

This crate uses `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` to ensure everything is implemented in 100% safe Rust.

## ü¶Ä | Minimum supported Rust version

Rama's MSRV is `1.75`.

## üß≠ | Roadmap

Please refer to <https://github.com/plabayo/rama/milestones> to know what's on the roadmap. Is there something not on the roadmap for the next version that you would really like? Please [create a feature request](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/issues) to request it and [become a sponsor](#sponsors) if you can.

### Acknowledgements

Special thanks goes to all involved in developing, maintaining and supporting [the Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), the [Tokio ecosystem](https://tokio.rs/) and [all other crates](./Cargo.toml) that we depend upon.

Extra credits also go to [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum), from which ideas and code were copied as its a project very much in line with the kind of software we want Rama to be, but for a different purpose. Our hats also go off to [Tower](https://github.com/tower-rs/tower), its inventors and all the people and creatures that help make it be every day. The initial code for the SOCKS5 support was copied from EAimTY's codebases.

## üíñ | Sponsors

Rama is **completely free, open-source software** which needs lots of effort and time to develop and maintain.

Support this project by becoming a [sponsor][ghs-url]. One time payments are accepted [at GitHub][ghs-url] as well as at ["Buy me a Coffee"][bmac-url]

Sponsors help us continue to maintain and improve `rama`, as well as other
Free and Open Source (FOSS) technology. It also helps us to create
educational content such as <https://github.com/plabayo/learn-rust-101>,
and other open source libraries such as <https://github.com/plabayo/tower-async>.

Sponsors receive perks and depending on your regular contribution it also
allows you to rely on us for support and consulting.

### Contribute to Open Source

Part of the money we receive from sponsors is used to contribute to other projects
that we depend upon. Plabayo sponsors the following organisations and individuals
building and maintaining open source software that `rama` depends upon:
