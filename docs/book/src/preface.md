🦙 Rama (ラマ) is a modular service framework for the 🦀 Rust language to move and transform your network packets.
The reasons behind the creation of rama can be read in [the "Why Rama" chapter](./why_rama.md).

You can use it to develop:

- 🚦 [Reverse proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/reverse);
- 🔓 [TLS Termination proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/tls);
- 🌐 [HTTP(S) proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/http);
- 🧦 [SOCKS5 proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/socks5) (will be implemented in `v0.3`);
- 🔎 [MITM proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/mitm);
- 🕵️‍♀️ [Distortion proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/distort) <sup>(\*)</sup>.

And all kind of other proxies that you can think of. Next to this Rama can also be used
for developing [web servers](https://ramaproxy.org/book/web_servers.html). Within a proxy setting this can be useful
in case you want to hijack certain requests with your custom server, or because you want to use pseudo domains
to serve an API as part of your proxy. Or you might want to serve your MITM TLS certs. And of course you might also
use it to develop a regular web service, which comes with all the great benefits that rama has to offer for developing proxies.

In fact you can even
[use rama as a high-level highly customisable http client](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/tree/main/examples/http_high_level_client.rs),
as part of your proxy, an emulated UA or just a plain old http client, made for you. Because you... deserve it!

In short... Rama (ラマ) is a framework to help you move and transform network packets. The primary
focus is distortion proxies, but you'll see, it can do so much more. And [with your help](./crate.md) it will only become better.

If you are new to proxy technology you might want to start with reading [the proxies intro chapter (a World of Proxies)](./proxies/intro.md) first. You can learn more about the design, architecture and philosophy behind rama
[in the rama introduction chapters](./intro.md).

> <sup>(\*)</sup> The [Distortion proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/distort) support
> comes with UA emulation capabilities. Part of this uses actual browser fingerprint information
> generated by [`rama-fp`](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/tree/main/rama-fp), Responsible for the collection, storage and transformation
> of browser fingerprint data, as is relevant for `rama`.
>
> While this is not meant for humans, you can also use the public facing service yourself,
> to get to know your own UA a bit better. It also gives you insights in the Rama POV,
> and what might still need to be improved.
>
> The service is available at <https://fp.ramaproxy.org>.

Rama is async-first using [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) as its _only_ Async Runtime.
Please refer to [the examples found in the `/examples` dir](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/tree/main/examples)
to get inspired on how you can use it for your purposes.

> 🫶 Rama is gratis FOSS and the repo with the full source code can be found
