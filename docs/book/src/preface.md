🦙 Rama (ラマ) is a modular proxy framework for the 🦀 Rust language to move and transform your network packets.
The reasons behind the creation of rama can be read in [the "Why Rama" chapter](./why_rama.md).

You can use it to develop:

- 🚦 [Reverse proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/reverse);
- 🔓 [TLS Termination proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/tls);
- 🌐 [HTTP(S) proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/http);
- 🧦 [SOCKS5 proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/socks5) (will be implemented in `v0.3`);
- 🔎 [MITM proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/mitm);
- 🕵️‍♀️ [Distortion proxies](https://ramaproxy.org/book/proxies/distort).

If you are new to proxy technology you might want to start with reading [the proxies intro chapter (a World of Proxies)](./proxies/intro.md) first. You can learn more about the design, architecture and philosophy behind rama
[in the rama introduction chapters](./intro.md).

Rama is async-first using [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) as its _only_ Async Runtime.
Please refer to [the examples found in the `./examples` dir](./examples)
to get inspired on how you can use it for your purposes.

> 🫶 Rama is gratis FOSS and the repo with the full source code can be found
> at <https://github.com/plabayo/rama>.
