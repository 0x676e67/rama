# A world of Proxies

It must be noted that many proxy servers will be a combination of
different kinds and some are a superset of another one.

In specifically we'll discuss:

- [🚦 Reverse proxies](./reverse.md)
- [🔓 TLS termination proxies](./tls.md)
- [🌐 HTTP(S) proxies](./http.md)
- [🧦 SOCKS5 proxies](./socks5.md)
