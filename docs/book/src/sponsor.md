Plabayo was co-founded in 2021 by Elizabeth C. Gonzales Belsuzarri and Glen Henri J. De Cauwsemaecker
to develop free and open source software, next to providing consultancy and educational services.

Rama has its roots in R&D of proxy technology, and active development on Rama started at the beginning of 2022.

Next to becoming a code contributor and/or code user you can also choose to financially sponsor
Plabayo which allows us to continue to develop it as free and open source technology,
licensed permissively.

Financial contributors help in compensate for the many unpaid developer hours we put in a project such as `rama`, but we also have plenty of costs, such as services ranging from hosting to Docker, but also tooling for developers and automated processing. All these costs money.

One time or monthly contributions can be made via GitHub Sponsors at
<https://github.com/sponsors/plabayo>, where you can also read about our different
tiers for the monthly version.

Alternatively you can also make a one time contribution at
<https://www.buymeacoffee.com/plabayo>.

One-time and monthly financial contributions are also possible via Paypal, should you feel more at ease with that at ["Paypal Donations"](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=P3KCGT2ACBVFE).

Finally, you can also support us by shopping Plabayo <3 `„É©„Éû` merchandise üõçÔ∏è at <https://plabayo.threadless.com/>.
